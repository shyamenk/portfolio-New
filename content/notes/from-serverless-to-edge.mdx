Traditionally, the Edge was more of a distributed network for storing
static assets closer to the users. CDNs represent the first wave of the
Edge network, reducing the transport time (i.e., latency) by being
physically closer to the user and improving performance.

As CDNs become more advanced, computing at the Edge is also emerging as a
service all around the network. The next generation of the Edge promises to
combine static-content CDNs with computing power on the Edge servers.

But first, let's start with the underlying serverless architecture.

## What is Serverless?

In the early days of the web, anyone who wanted to build a web application
had to own and manage the physical hardware required to run a server
on-premise. That included computing, networking, and storage resources, a
lot for one organization to own and maintain.

In early 2000, Amazon Web Services (AWS) developed a new cloud computing
service model, the infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which abstracted the
lower infrastructure layers. It was much more cost-efficient than owning
and maintaining the infrastructure and way faster to provision and get your
servers up and running.

The next model up was platform as a service (PaaS), which further provided
the operating system and the runtime on top of the underlying
infrastructure. PaaS takes advantage of all the virtualized resources from
IaaS and allows developers to focus solely on the application layer.
Platforms like Heroku gained popularity as developers wanted to spend less
time configuring infrastructure and more time building their applications.

With the advancements in virtualization technologies, AWS introduced yet
another layer of abstraction in 2014: AWS Lambda functions or functions as
a service (FaaS), which reduces the application's logic to individual tasks
that can execute in response to different events. As single units of code
deployed to the cloud provider's infrastructure, functions acted as the
compute engine enabling the new serverless architecture.

Serverless architecture abstracts away the details of maintaining servers
and the underlying infrastructure and enables developers to focus on
business logic and building applications without worrying about
provisioning and configuring servers. This further expedited the decoupling
of monolithic architecture into dedicated, specialized services running in
separate processes, known as the microservices architecture.

## The Advent of Edge Functions

One of the problems when dealing with servers, whether managed by you or
the cloud service provider is network latency, the effect of physical
distance between users and the origin server on response time.

So far, the solution has been to generate static pages so we can serve them
faster from CDNs on the Edge. However, this comes at the cost of losing
dynamic content. Speed and personalization are often at odds. But what if
we could run code at the Edge?

Serverless computing continues to evolve as providers develop solutions to
overcome its drawbacks. Edge functions aim to bring serverless functions
closer to the users by combining the serverless architecture with the CDN
Edge network, allowing code to run at the Edge.

Edge computing is a model in which storage and computing move closer to the
end-user. This way, we can have the power of dynamic at the speed of
static.

Edge functions are essentially serverless functions hosted on edge servers
that can process HTTP requests before they travel back to the origin
server. The more geographically distributed edge locations are, the fewer
users will experience latency.

Generally speaking, possible use cases can be anything that involves
intercepting the client's request before returning the response.

### Example Use Cases

- Authentication.
- Redirect and Rewrite based on the user geolocation.
- Add or modify request/response headers.
- Read, write and manage cookies.
- Render and return a page or component.
- Respond with some JSON, like an API endpoint.
- Enforce a block or IP allow-list.
- A/B testing with different content.

### State

Edge applications will generally need both compute and state. API-based
serverless databases fill the state side of that equation while we wait for
databases at the Edge to mature. [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) and
[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) are examples of database platforms
explicitly designed for serverless architecture.

### Example

One of the easiest ways to use Edge functions is the new
[NextJS Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware).
By default, middlewares are deployed as Edge functions when hosted on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Using NextJS middlewares deployed as Edge functions to Vercel, you don't
need to worry about configuring infrastructure. Middlewares enables you to
use code over configuration and run code closer to your users on Vercel's
Edge network. Let's take a look at an example:

You can define a middleware by creating a `_middleware.js` file inside the
`/pages` folder.

```jsx title="pages/_middleware.js"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const country = req.geo?.country || 'us'
  return NextResponse.rewrite(`/${country}`)
  // rewrites to https://example.com/us
  // if geolocation data is not available
}
```

This middleware function would now run before all requests to your site. It
will look at the user's location and rewrite the request to the user's
country: `/${country}`.

### Experiment at the Edge

[Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) uses Edge Middleware to personalize
content at the Edge. Based on the incoming request, Edge Middleware can run
A/B tests for the current visitor and route the request to one of the
possible variants from the edge server.

Rather than needing to load heavy client-side libraries or deal with layout
shifts from validating whether the visitor was part of the current
experiment, personalization at the Edge helps you achieve outstanding
performance and a great user experience.

## The Future

With React Server Components in development, you'll be able to render pages
at the Edge close to your users with zero client-side JavaScript, which
will improve the user experience by combining the best of server-side
rendering and client-side interactivity.

On a broader level, the reduction in latency brought by Edge computing
coupled with the evolution of 5G networks and faster devices can bring in a
new generation of previously unattainable application use cases.
