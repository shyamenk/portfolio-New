This note covers handling authentication in NextJS using the
[next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) package. It goes over strategies,
patterns and providers you can use to implement authentication in your
application.

## Getting Started

To add next-auth to a project, create a file called `[...nextauth].js` in
`pages/api/auth` folder. This contains the dynamic route handler and all of
your global configurations.

```jsx showLineNumbers title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import GithubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET
    })
    // ...add more providers here
  ]
})
```

All requests to `api/auth/*` (e.g. signIn, signOut, etc.) will
automatically be handled by next-auth.

### Options

You can pass different configuration options when initializing `NextAuth`:

#### `providers`

- Default value: [ ]
- Required: Yes

Authentication Providers are services that can be used to sign in a user.
next-auth comes with a lot of different built-in providers, here is a high
level summary of the three main categories:

- [OAuth provider](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth)
  (e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.)
- [Email Provider](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/email)
  (passwordless magic links)
- [Credentials Provider](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/credentials)
  (e.g. username & password)

#### Using OAuth Provider

next-auth is designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports OAuth
1.0, 1.0A, 2.0 and OpenID Connect and has built-in support for most popular
sign-in services.This allows users to sign in with their favorite
pre-existing logins.

##### How To

1.  Register your application at the developer portal of your provider.
2.  The redirect URL (or callback URL) should follow this format:

```mdx
[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]
```

For example, using Google, the redirect URL would look like this:

```mdx
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google
```

3. Set **client ID** and **client secret** environment variables. For
   Google this would be:

```mdx title=".env.local"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

4. Add the provider settings to the NextAuth options object. You can add as
   many OAuth providers as you like.

```jsx {2,6-9} showLineNumbers title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
    })
    // ...add more providers here
  ]
})
```

5. Once a provider has been set up, you can sign in at the following URL:
   `/api/auth/signin`. This will render your custom sign-in page (if any)
   or the default auto-generated page with all the configured providers.

#### Using Email Provider

The Email provider is a passwordless login solution that sends "magic
links" via email for the user to click on and sign in.

Adding the Email provider in addition to OAuth services, provides a way for
users to sign in if they lose access to their OAuth account.

A user account (i.e. an entry in the Users table) will not be created for
the user until the first time they verify their email address. If an email
address is already associated with an account, the user will be signed in
to that account when they use the link in the email.

The Email Provider can be used with both JSON Web Tokens and database
sessions, but you must configure a database adapter to persist the
verification tokens. It is not possible to enable email sign in without
using a database.

##### How To

1. You'll need to install
   [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) if you want to
   use the Email provider.

```mdx
npm install nodemailer
```

2.  You will need an SMTP account; ideally one that
    [works with nodemailer](http://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/).

3.  Configure the SMTP server connection by either using a connection
    string or a configuration object.

    - **Using a connection string**, add the connection string to your
      environment variables:

      ```mdx title=".env.local"
      EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://username:password@smtp.example.com:587
      EMAIL_FROM=hello@example.com
      ```

      You can add the email provider to you NextAuth config:

      ```jsx {2,6-9} showLineNumbers title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
      import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
      import EmailProvider from 'next-auth/providers/email'

      export default NextAuth({
        providers: [
          EmailProvider({
            server: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER,
            from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM
          })
        ]
      })
      ```

    - **Using a configuration object**, add the configuration object
      options individually:

      ```mdx title=".env.local"
      EMAIL_SERVER_USER=username  
      EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=password  
      EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.example.com  
      EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587  
      EMAIL_FROM=hello@example.com
      ```

      Now you can add the provider settings to the NextAuth options object
      in the Email Provider.

      ```jsx {2,6-16} showLineNumbers title="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
      import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
      import EmailProvider from 'next-auth/providers/email'

      export default NextAuth({
        providers: [
          EmailProvider({
            server: {
              host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
              port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
              auth: {
                user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
                pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
              }
            },
            from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM
          })
        ]
      })
      ```

4.  Set up a [database adapter](#adapter) for storing the email
    verification token.

5.  You can now sign in with an email at `/api/auth/signin`.

You can fully customize the email that is sent by passing the
`sendVerificationRequest` function option to the Email provider. See
[here](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email#customizing-emails) for
more details.

#### Using Credentials Provider

The Credentials provider allows you to handle signing in with arbitrary
credentials, such as a username / password, two-factor authentication, etc.
It supports use cases where you have an existing system you need to
authenticate users against.

The Credentials provider does not work with database sessions and can only
be used if JSON Web Tokens are enabled for sessions. As a result users
authenticated with the Credentials provider are not persisted in the
database.

The Credentials provider is specified like other providers, except that you
need to define the `authorize` function that accepts credentials submitted
via an HTTP POST request as input and returns either:

1. A user object, which indicates the credentials are valid. If you return
   an object it will be persisted to the JSON Web Token and the user will
   be signed in.

2. If you return `null`, the user will be sent to the `signin` page with
   the error message as a query parameter. If you're using the
   auto-generated `signin` page the error will be displayed to the user.

3. If you throw an Error, the user will be sent to the `error` page with
   the error message as a query parameter. If you're using the
   auto-generated `error` page the error will be displayed to the user.

```jsx {2,7-27} showLineNumbers
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'
import loginUser from '@utils/database'

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: 'Credentials',
      credentials: {
        username: {
          label: 'Username',
          type: 'text',
          placeholder: 'username'
        },
        password: { label: 'Password', type: 'password' }
      },
      async authorize(credentials, req) {
        const { email, password } = credentials
        const user = await loginUser(email, password)

        if (user) {
          return user
        } else {
          return null
        }
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

##### Credentials Provider Options

- `name`  
  The name to display on the built-in sign in page (e.g. "Sign in with...")
- `credentials`  
  The credentials is used to generate a suitable form on the sign in page.
  You can specify whatever fields you are expecting to be submitted e.g.
  domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc..You can pass any HTML
  attribute to the `input` tag through this object.
- `authorize`  
  Add logic here to look up the user from the supplied credentials. If you
  return an object from this function the user will be signed in and the
  object will be saved in the `user` property of the JWT. This method also
  receives the `req` object as the second parameter to obtain additional
  information such as the request IP address.

#### `secret`

- Default value: No default in production
- Required: Yes (if `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is not set)

A random string used to hash tokens, cookies and generate cryptographic
keys. If you set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` as an environment variable, you don't
need to define this option (recommended).

#### `session`

- Default value: object (shown below)
- Required: No

```jsx
...
// The default session object
session: {
  strategy: "jwt",
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
  updateAge: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours
}
...
```

The `session` object is optional and can contain the following properties:

- `strategy: "database" | "jwt"`  
  Choose how you want to save the user session. It defaults to `jwt`, where
  an encrypted JWT (JWE) is stored in the session cookie.

  However, if you define an `adapter`, it will default to `database`
  instead, where the session is saved to the database and the cookie will
  only contain the `sessionId Token` used to look up the session in the
  database.

  When using an adapter, you can still force a JWT session by explicitly
  setting `jwt` as the `strategy`.

- `maxAge` (seconds)  
  How long until an idle session expires and is no longer valid.

- `updateAge` (seconds)  
  Define how frequently to update the database to extend a session. Set it
  to `0` to always update the database. This option is ignored if using
  JSON Web Tokens.

#### `pages`

- Default value: {}
- Required: No

The next-auth package comes with built-in sign in, sign out and error
pages, however, you can create your own custom pages and specify the URLs
in the `pages` options when setting up `NextAuth`.

```jsx
...
pages: {
  signIn: '/auth/signin',
  signOut: '/auth/signout',
  error: '/auth/error',
  verifyRequest: '/auth/verify-request',
  newUser: '/auth/new-user'
}
...
```

Pages specified will override the corresponding built-in page. You can
leave out any of the pages you're not interested and next-auth will use the
default built-in page instead when needed.

Setting up your own custom pages is pretty straight forward. You can
consult the
[pages documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/pages) for
finer details.

#### `callbacks`

- Default value: object
- Required: No

Callbacks are asynchronous functions you can use to control what happens
when an action is performed. You can specify a handler for any of the
following callbacks:

```jsx
...
callbacks: {
  async signIn({ user, account, profile, email, credentials }) {
    return true
  },
  async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
    return baseUrl
  },
  async session({ session, token, user }) {
    return session
  },
  async jwt({ token, user, account, profile, isNewUser }) {
    return token
  }
}
...
```

For example if you want to pass data such as the `access_token` to the
browser when using **JSON Web Tokens**, you can persist the data in the
token when the `jwt` callback is called, then pass the data through to the
browser in the `session` callback.

```jsx {4,9} showLineNumbers
...
callbacks: {
  async jwt({ token, account }) {
    if (account) {
      token.accessToken = account.access_token
    }
    return token
  }
  async session({ session, token, user }) {
    session.accessToken = token.accessToken
    return session
  }
}
...
```

When using **JSON Web Tokens** the `jwt` callback is invoked before the
`session` callback, so anything you add to the `token` will be immediately
available in the `session` callback, like the `accessToken` in the example
above.

See the
[callbacks documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks)
for more information on how to use callback functions.

#### `adapter`

- Default value: none
- Required: No

If you prefer to use database sessions over JSON web tokens, or when you
would like to persist user data, you need to install an
[adapter](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/overview). You also need an
adapter if you are using the **Email Provider** (for persisting
verification tokens).

When you specify an adapter, your `session.strategy` will default to
`database`. You can still use `jwt` by explicitly setting it:

```jsx
...
adapter: MongoDBAdapter(clientPromise),
session: {
  strategy: 'jwt',
},
...
```

#### `theme`

- Default value: object
- Required: No

```jsx
...
theme: {
  colorScheme: "auto",
  brandColor: "",
  logo: ""
}
...
```

- `colorScheme: "auto" | "dark" | "light"`  
  Changes the color theme of the default built-in
  (signin/signout/verify-request/error) pages. Set it to `light`, if you
  want to force pages to always be light, and `dark` to always force a dark
  theme. Set it to `auto` or leave it out if you want the pages to follow
  the preferred system theme.
- `brandColor`: (Hex) Changes the accent color used in the default pages.
- `logo`: URL of your logo, which will be rendered above the main card in
  the default pages.

For a list of other options you can pass to `NextAuth`, you can refer to
the
[Options documentation page](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options).

### Environment Variables

#### NEXTAUTH_URL

When deploying to production, set the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable to
the canonical URL of your site.

```mdx title=".env.local"
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://example.com
```

#### NEXTAUTH_SECRET

Used to encrypt the JSON Web Token (JWT), and to hash email verification
tokens. This is the default value for the `secret` option. And if you are
using Middleware this environment variable must be set.

```mdx title=".env.local"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=random-secret-string
```

Now that we're done setting up next-auth, let's see how we can use it on
the client side.

## Client API

The client API makes it easy to access the session from React.

#### Example Session Object

```jsx
{
  user: {
    name: string
    email: string
    image: string
  },
  expires: Date // session expiry
}
```

The session object contains enough data to display information about the
user (e.g name, email, image). You can use the
[session callback](#callbacks) to return additional data in the session
object.

To access the session object, you'll need to first expose the session
context at the top level of your application via the `SessionProvider`.

### SessionProvider

The `SessionProvider` exposes the session across your app using
[React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

```jsx {5-7} showLineNumbers title="pages/_app.js"
import { SessionProvider } from 'next-auth/react'

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <SessionProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </SessionProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

If you pass the `session` prop to the `SessionProvider`, you can avoid
checking the session twice on pages that support both server-side and
client-side rendering.

```jsx {3} showLineNumbers title="pages/_app.js"
...
<SessionProvider session={pageProps.session}>
  <Component {...pageProps} />
</SessionProvider>
...
```

Obviously, this would only work on pages where you pass the session as a
prop, This is usually done in `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps`:

```jsx {9} showLineNumbers title="pages/index.js"
import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react'

// your page component
export default const Page = () => { ... }

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      session: await getSession(context)
    }
  }
}
```

If all your pages require authentication, then you can provide the
`session` prop via the `getInitialProps` in the `_app.js`.

<BackgroundReading
  href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app"
  title="Background reading:"
>
  Custom App Component
</BackgroundReading>

Alternatively, you can handle authentication client-side as described in
the next section.

#### Options

Other than the `session` you can pass other props to the `SessionProvider`
component:

- `session`: to pass the session if it was already fetched from the page.
- `basePath`: in case you use a custom path like "/app" rather than the
  root "/".
- `refetchInterval`: how often (in seconds) the client should contact the
  server to update the session. Defaults to 0 which means no session
  polling.
- `refetchOnWindowFocus`: control whether client should update the session
  when you switch focus on tabs/windows. Defaults to `true`.

```jsx {3-6} showLineNumbers title="pages/_app.js"
...
<SessionProvider
  session={pageProps.session}
  basePath="app"
  refetchInterval={5 * 60} // refetch session every 5 minutes
  refetchOnWindowFocus={true} // refetch session when focused
>
  <Component {...pageProps} />
</SessionProvider>
...
```

Now that we have exposed the session context, let's see how we can access
it from our components using the `useSession` custom hook.

### useSession

- Client side: Yes
- Server side: No

The `useSession` hook is the easiest way to check the session on the
client-side.

```jsx {4} showLineNumbers
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

const Component = () => {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession()

  if (status === 'loading') {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (status === 'authenticated') {
    return <div>Signed in as {session.user.email}</div>
  }

  return <a href="/api/auth/signin">Sign in</a>
}

export default Component
```

`useSession` returns an object containing the following values:

- `data`: this can be either
  - `undefined`: when the session hasn't been fetched yet.
  - `null`: when failed to retrieve the session.
  - The session object.
- `status`: one of three possible session states:
  - "loading"
  - "authenticated"
  - "unauthenticated"

#### Options

You can pass an options object to the `useSession` hook with the following
properties and methods:

- `required`: when set to `true`, it makes sure you always have a valid
  session.
- `onUnauthenticated`: is called when there is no session found.
- `onFail`: is called when failed to fetched the session.

#### Using the `required: true` option

when you pass `required: true` option to the `useSession` hook, it makes
sure you always have a valid session. If after the initial loading state
there was no session found, it redirects the user to the sign-in page, from
where - after a successful login - the user will be sent back to the page
they started on. You can override this behavior by providing your own
`onUnauthenticated` method.

```jsx {4} showLineNumbers title="pages/protected.js"
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

const Page = () => {
  const { status } = useSession({ required: true })

  // when `required: true` is passed,
  // `status` can only be "loading" or "authenticated"
  if (status === 'loading') {
    return 'Loading...'
  }

  return 'User is logged in'
}

export default Page
```

To take this even further, instead of calling `useSession` inside every
protected page individually, you can manage this at the top level
`_app.js`.

```jsx {6-12} showLineNumbers title="pages/_app.js"
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <SessionProvider session={pageProps.session}>
      {Component.auth ? (
        <Auth>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </Auth>
      ) : (
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      )}
    </SessionProvider>
  )
}

function Auth({ children }) {
  const { status } = useSession({ required: true })

  // when `required: true` is passed,
  // `status` can only be "loading" or "authenticated"
  if (status === 'loading') {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  return children
}

export default App
```

Now all you need to do to protect a page, is to set the `auth` property on
the page component to `true`.

```jsx {6} showLineNumbers title="pages/protected.js"
const Page = () => {
  // session is always non-null inside this page
  return 'User is logged in'
}

Page.auth = true

export default Page
```

`useSession` made it easy to access the shared session on the client-side.
Now let's see how we can check the session on the server-side using
`getSession`.

### getSession

- Client side: Yes
- Server side: Yes

The `getSession` function calls the `/api/auth/session` endpoint and
returns a promise that resolves to a session object, or `null` if no
session exists. It can be called both server-side or client-side.

#### Client Side Example

```jsx {4} showLineNumbers title="pages/index.js"
import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react'

async function myFunction() {
  const session = await getSession()
  ...
}
```

#### Server Side Example

When calling `getSession` server side, you need to pass `{req}` or the
`context` object.

```jsx {4} showLineNumbers title="pages/api/endpoint.js"
import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react'

export default async (req, res) => {
  const session = await getSession({ req })
  if (session) {
    // Signed in
  } else {
    // Not Signed in
  }
  res.end()
}
```

Using `getSession` you can easily protect your API routes and any
server-side code executed inside `getServerSideProps`.

Now let's see how users can create an account and/or sign in.

### signIn

- Client side: Yes
- Server side: No

Using the `signIn` method makes sure:

- The user is redirected back to the page they started after completing the
  sign-in flow.
- Handles CSRF tokens when signing in with email.

```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react'

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => signIn()}>Sign in</button>
      </nav>
    </header>
  )
}

export default Header
```

`signIn` method can be called in different ways

- When called with no arguments, the user will be redirected to the sign in
  page, where the user can choose what authentication method they prefer.
- When passed the provider's `id` as the first argument, it redirects to
  the provider's page directly and starts the sign-in flow.

For example to sign in with Google:

```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react'

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => signIn('google')}>
          Sign in with Google
        </button>
      </nav>
    </header>
  )
}

export default Header
```

You can also pass options such as:

- `email` for email provider sign-in flow.
- Any credentials for credentials provider sign-in flow (e.g. email &
  password).
- `callbackUrl` to which URL the user will be redirected after signing in,
  it defaults to the current URL.
- `redirect: false` to disable the default redirection and stay on the same
  page. This option is only available for **credentials** and **email**
  providers.

options are passed via an options object as the second parameter, for
example to sign in with email and redirect to `/foo` after completion:

```jsx {16} showLineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react'

const SignInForm = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')

  return (
    <form>
      <input
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button
        onClick={() => signIn('email', { email, callbackUrl: '/foo' })}
      >
        Sign in with Email
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}

export default SignInForm
```

#### Using the `redirect: false` option

Sometimes you may want to deal with the sign-in response on the same page.
For example, if an error occurs you may want to handle the error on the
same page and show an error message to the user. You can pass
`redirect: false` option.

```jsx
const response = await signIn('credentials', { password, redirect: false })
```

Now `signIn` returns a promise that will resolve to the following object:

```jsx
{
  error: string | undefined
  status: number
  ok: boolean
  url: string | null
}
```

You can check the `ok` property or the `error` to see if the sign-in was
successful.

#### Additional Parameters

you can also pass additional parameters to the `/authorize` endpoint
through the third argument of the `signIn` method.

```jsx
signIn('auth0', null, { login_hint: 'info@example.com' })
```

### signOut

- Client side: Yes
- Server side: No

Using the `signOut` method makes sure:

- The user is redirected back to the page they started, after signing out.
- Handles CSRF tokens automatically.
- Reloads the page in the browser when sign-out flow is completed.

```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
import { signOut } from 'next-auth/react'

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign Out</button>
      </nav>
    </header>
  )
}

export default Header
```

You can also pass options such as:

- `callbackUrl` to which URL the user will be redirected after signing out,
  it defaults to the current URL.
- `redirect: false` to disable the default redirection and page reload.

options are passed via an options object, for example to sign out and
redirect to `/foo` after completion:

```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
import { signOut } from 'next-auth/react'

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => signOut({ callbackUrl: '/foo' })}>
          Sign Out
        </button>
      </nav>
    </header>
  )
}

export default Header
```

#### Using the `redirect: false` option

When passed the `redirect: false` option, the user will be logged out and
the session will be deleted without the default redirection and page
reload.

```jsx
const response = await signOut({ redirect: false })
```

Now `signOut` returns a promise that will resolve to the following object:

```jsx
{
  url: string
}
```

`url` is the validated URL the user would've been redirected to otherwise.
Therefor if you want to redirect the user to another page after signing out
without reloading the page, you can use the `url` value returned from
`signOut`, and redirect the user with `useRouter` hook from `next-router`.

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

const router = useRouter()
const { url } = await signOut({ redirect: false, callbackUrl: '/foo' })
router.push(url)
```
