The `Image` component, is an extension of the HTML `<img>` element, evolved
for the modern web. It includes a variety of built-in performance
optimizations such as:

- **Improved Performance**: always serve correctly sized images for each
  device, using modern image formats.
- **Visual Stability**: prevent Cumulative Layout Shift automatically.
- **Faster Page Loads**: images are only loaded when they enter the
  viewport, with optional blur-up placeholders
- **Asset Flexibility**: on-demand image resizing, even for images stored
  on remote servers

To add an image to your application, import the `next/image` component:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'
```

### Required Props

#### src

Must be one of the following:

- A statically imported image file
- A path string. This can be either an absolute external URL or an internal
  path depending on the loader prop or loader configuration.

#### width

The width of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.
Required, except for statically imported images, or those with
`layout="fill"`.

#### height

The height of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.
Required, except for statically imported images, or those with
`layout="fill"`.

### Local Images

To use a local image, import your `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.webp` files:

```jsx
import profilePic from '../public/me.png'
```

NextJS will automatically determine the width and height of your image
based on the imported file. These values are used to prevent Cumulative
Layout Shift while your image is loading.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import Image from 'next/image'
import profilePic from '../public/me.png'

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Image
        src={profilePic}
        alt="Picture of the author"
        // width={500} automatically provided
        // height={500} automatically provided
        // blurDataURL="data:..." automatically provided
        placeholder="blur" // Optional blur-up while loading
      />
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
```

Dynamic await `import` or `require` are not supported. The import must be
static so it can be analyzed at build time.

### Remote Images

To use a remote image, the `src` property should be a URL string, which can
be **relative** or **absolute**. Because NextJS does not have access to
remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the `width`,
`height` and optional `blurDataURL` props manually:

```jsx {6,8-9} showLineNumbers
import Image from 'next/image'

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/me.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}

export default Home
```

Sometimes you may want to access a remote image but still, use the built-in
NextJS Image Optimization API. To do this, leave the loader at its default
setting and enter an **absolute** URL for the image `src`.

```jsx {2} showLineNumbers
<Image
  src="https://cdn.example.com/me.png"
  alt="Picture of the author"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>
```

To protect your application from malicious users, you must define a list of
remote domains that you intend to access this way. This is configured in
your `next.config.js` file, as shown below:

```jsx {3} showLineNumbers title="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['cdn.example.com']
  }
}
```

### Loaders

Note that in the example earlier, a partial URL ("/me.png") is provided for
a remote image. This is possible because of the `next/image` loader.

A loader is a function that generates the URLs for your image. It appends a
root domain to your provided src and generates multiple URLs to request the
image at different sizes. These multiple URLs are used in the automatic
`srcset` generation so that visitors to your site will be served an image
that is the right size for their viewport.

The default loader for NextJS applications uses the built-in Image
Optimization API, which optimizes images from anywhere on the web, and then
serves them directly from the NextJS web server. If you would like to serve
your images directly from a CDN or image server, you can use one of the
built-in loaders or write your own with a few lines of JavaScript.

```jsx {3-5,10} showLineNumbers
import Image from 'next/image'

const myLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {
  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`
}

const MyImage = props => {
  return (
    <Image
      loader={myLoader}
      src="me.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}

export default MyImage
```

Loaders can be defined per image, or at the application level. Setting the
loader as a prop on the Image component overrides the default loader
defined in the images section of `next.config.js`.

#### Built-in Loaders

The following Image Optimization cloud providers are included:

- **Default**: works automatically with `next dev`, `next start`, or a
  custom server
- **Vercel**: works automatically when you deploy on
  [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Imgix**: `loader: 'imgix'`
- **Cloudinary**: `loader: 'cloudinary'`
- **Akamai**: `loader: 'akamai'`
- **Custom**: `loader: 'custom'` use a custom cloud provider by
  implementing the loader prop on the `next/image` component

```jsx {3-4} showLineNumbers title="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  images: {
    loader: 'cloudinary',
    path: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/myaccount'
  }
}
```

This loader will generate the URLs for your image. It appends the root
domain specified in the `path` to the partial URL provided in the `src` in
the Image component and generates multiple URLs to request the image at
different sizes. example:

```mdx
https://res.cloudinary.com/myaccount/f_auto,c_cover,w_500/me.png
```

The default loader uses [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) because it is quick
to install and suitable for a development environment. When using
`next start` in your production environment, it is strongly recommended
that you install [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) by running
`yarn add sharp` in your project directory. This is not necessary for
Vercel deployments, as sharp is installed automatically.

### Image Sizing

Because the `next/image` is designed to guarantee good performance results,
it cannot be used in a way that will contribute to layout shift, and must
be sized in one of three ways:

- **Automatically**, using a static import
- **Explicitly**, by including a `width` and `height` property
- **Implicitly**, by using `layout="fill"` which causes the image to expand
  to fill its parent element.

### Optional Image props

#### layout

The layout prop defines the behavior of the image as the viewport changes
size. It can be one of the following four values:

- **intrinsic**: this is the default value, it makes the image scale down
  to fit the width of the container, but does not scale up beyond the
  original image dimensions.

- **responsive**: scales up or down to fit the container width. Ensure the
  parent container uses `display: block`

- **fill**: grows in both width and height to fill the container. It will
  stretch both width and height to the dimensions of the parent element.
  This is usually paired with `objectFit` property to avoid distorting the
  image while stretching. Ensure the parent element uses
  `position: relative`

- **fixed**: the image dimensions will not change as the viewport changes
  (no responsiveness) similar to the native `<img />` element.

#### sizes

A string that provides information about how wide the image will be at
different breakpoints. Defaults to `100vw` when using `layout="responsive"`
or` layout="fill"`.

If you are using `layout="fill"` or `layout="responsive",` it's important
to assign sizes for any image that takes up less than the full viewport
width.

For example, when the parent element will constrain the image to always be
less than half the viewport width, use `sizes="50vw"`. Without sizes, the
image will be sent at twice the necessary resolution, decreasing
performance.

If you are using `layout="intrinsic"` or `layout="fixed"`, then `sizes` is
not needed because the upper bound width is constrained already.

#### quality

The quality of the optimized image, it's an integer between 1 and 100 where
100 is the best quality. Defaults to 75.

#### priority

When true, the image will be considered high priority and preload. Lazy
loading is automatically disabled for images using `priority`.

```jsx {6} showLineNumbers
<Image
  src="/me.png"
  alt="Picture of the author"
  width={500}
  height={500}
  priority
/>
```

You should use the priority property on any image detected as the Largest
Contentful Paint (LCP) element. Should only be used when the image is
visible above the fold. Defaults to `false`.

#### placeholder

A placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are "blur"
or "empty". Defaults to "empty".

When "blur", the `blurDataURL` property will be used as the placeholder. If
`src` is an object from a static import and the imported image is `.jpg`,
`.png`, `.webp`, or `.avif`, then `blurDataURL` will be automatically
populated.

For dynamic images, you must provide the `blurDataURL` property.

When "empty", there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only
empty space.

#### blurDataURL

A Data URL to be used as a placeholder image before the image successfully
loads. Only takes effect when combined with `placeholder="blur"`.

Must be a **base64-encoded** image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a
very small image (10px or less) is recommended. Including larger images as
placeholders may harm your application performance.

#### objectFit

Defines how the image will fit into its parent container when using
`layout="fill"`. This value is passed to the `object-fit` CSS property for
the src image.

#### objectPosition

Defines how the image is positioned within its parent element when using
`layout="fill"`. This value is passed to the `object-position` CSS property
applied to the image.

### Styling Image component

Styling the `Image` component is not that different from styling a normal
`<img />` element, but there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

- Pick the correct `layout` mode
- Target the image with classes, not based on DOM structure. The
  recommended way to style the inner `<img />` is to set the `className`
  prop on the `Image` component.
- You cannot use the `style` prop because the `Image` component does not
  pass it through to the underlying `img`.
- When using `layout="fill"`, the parent element must have
  `position: relative`
- When using `layout="responsive"`, the parent element must have
  `display: block`
