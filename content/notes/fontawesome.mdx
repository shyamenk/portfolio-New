In this short note, we'll learn how to use
[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons in NextJS using the official
`react-fontawesome` component to make everything work just right.

There are two methods to render icons in NextJS/React:

- SVG + JS method
- Web fonts + CSS method

In this note, we'll cover the basics of using the official Fontawesome
react component, which uses the `SVG + JS` method to render icons. But you
can use the other method if you prefer.

## Setup

1. ### Add the core package

   First, install the core package which includes all the utilities we
   need.

   ```bash
   npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
   npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
   ```

2. ### Add the icon packages

   Next, install the icons you want to use. You can choose from Free of Pro
   icons.

   - #### Free

     For free icons you can add either one of these packages:

     ```bash
     # free icons
     npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
     npm i @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
     ```

   - #### Pro

     For Pro icons, you'll need to have an active subscription to a Pro
     plan and a valid Token (You can find it in your account).

     ##### Configure access

     you'll need to configure the `@fortawesome` scope via the npm
     registry. You can set this up globally or per-project.

     - ###### Set up npm Token for all projects

       This global setup will allow any of your projects to use the Font
       Awesome package and your token:

       ```bash
        npm config set "@fortawesome:registry" https://npm.fontawesome.com/
        npm config set "//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken" YOUR_TOKEN
       ```

     - ###### Set up npm Token for a specific project

       This allows you to configure each project individually. Create a
       `.npmrc` file in the root of your project and paste in the following
       snippet:

       ```bash title=".npmrc"
        @fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
        //npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN
       ```

     Once you've configured the access via the npm registry, you can add
     the icon packages that you plan to use in your app:

     ```bash
       # pro icons
       npm i @fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons
       npm i @fortawesome/pro-regular-svg-icons
       npm i @fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons
       npm i @fortawesome/pro-thin-svg-icons
       npm i @fortawesome/pro-duotone-svg-icons
       npm i @fortawesome/sharp-solid-svg-icons
     ```

3. ### Add the React component

   Now that we have installed the required packages let's add icons to our
   project using the `FontAwesomeIcon` element.

   There are a few ways to add icons when using React. The easiest way is
   to use dynamic import which only imports the icons you're using.

   #### Dynamic import

   Dynamic import eliminates the need to declare icons individually. This
   works thanks to the
   [babel macros plugin](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros).

   - ##### Install babel macros

     First, install the babel macros plugin:

     ```bash
       npm i babel-plugin-macros
     ```

   - ##### Configure babel config

     Next, configure babel to use `macros` plugin. Add the following to
     your `.babelrc` file:

     ```json
     {
       "presets": ["next/babel"],
       "plugins": ["macros"]
     }
     ```

     Then, create a `babel-plugin-macros.config.js` and add the
     `fontawesome-svg-core` settings. You can set the license to either
     'free' or 'pro' depending on the icons you are planning to use.

     ```js
     module.exports = {
       'fontawesome-svg-core': {
         license: 'free'
       }
     }
     ```

   - ##### Add icons to your project

     Now using the following syntax, you can add any icon to your project.

     ```jsx
      import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
      import {
        solid,
        regular,
        brands,
        icon
      } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core/import.macro'

      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={brands('twitter')} />
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={regular('coffee')} />
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={solid('user-secret')} />
      <FontAwesomeIcon icon={icon({name: 'coffee', style: 'solid'})} />
     ```

     In this example, we imported macros for `solid` or `regular` icons to
     render the 'coffee' and 'user-secret' icons in those styles.

     It also showed how to use the more general `icon` macro, which can be
     used to import an icon of any family and style, including the Sharp
     family (Pro only). It defaults to the Classic family.

   #### Alternative way to add icons

   If you don't want to use the dynamic import using babel macros plugin,
   you can add individual icons to each component:

   ```jsx
   import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
   import { faEnvelope } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

   const element = <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faEnvelope} />
   ```

4. ### Add some styling

   - #### Using Fontawesome styling toolkit

     The `FontAwesomeIcon` has built-in props for sizing, transforming, and
     even animating your icons:

     ```jsx
       /* Size */
       <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} size="xs" />
       <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} size="lg" />

       /* Rotate */
       <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} rotation={90} />

       /* Animate */
       <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBasketBall} bounce />
       <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBasketBall} fade />
     ```

     You can explore the Fontawesome
     [styling toolkit](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/style/styling) to
     see all available options for styling your icons.

   - #### Using CSS classes

     You can add styling to any component using the className property.

     ```jsx
     <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faSpinner} className="highlight" />
     ```

## Summary

That's it folks. You can now add any icon from the amazing fontawesome
library to your NextJS project and style it to match the vibe of your app.
