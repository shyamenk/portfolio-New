Single-page applications are distinguished from regular applications
because they do not need to make server requests when the user navigates.
they control navigation and reuse the active document instead of sending a
request to the server. However, the application still needs a server to
provide the initial files for the application to render.

There are two main ways we can serve a single-page application:

- Static server
- Dynamic server

## Static server

A static web server consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server
(software). We call it "static" because the server sends its hosted files
as-is to your browser. This means a static web server can only successfully
respond to requests if a resource at the requested location exists.

With a static server, a request for `/about.html` only succeeds if the
`about.html` file exists on the server. If the server doesn't find the
requested document, it returns a 404 response instead.

However, some static hosts allow you to respond with an alternative file
(fallback) if the requested resource doesnâ€™t actually exist on the server.
So if a request for the `/about.html` file comes in and the server has no
`about.html` file, it will respond with an `index.html` file instead.

## Dynamic server

A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software,
most commonly known as an _application server_ and a _database_. We call it
"dynamic" because the application server generates the files upon request
before sending them to your browser via the HTTP server.

For example, to produce the final web pages you see in the browser, the
application server might fill an HTML template with content from a
database. Sites like MDN or Wikipedia have thousands of web pages.
Typically, these kinds of sites are composed of only a few HTML templates
and a giant database, rather than thousands of static HTML files. This
setup makes it easier to maintain and deliver the content.

A dynamic server is able to match requests and dynamically generate
responses. This way the requests don't have to map directly to files on the
server.

## Serving SPA with a Static Server

If you are running a single page application through a static server, you
have three options, the first of which is how it used to be done (before
the advent of the browser History API)

- The old way was to have a single HTML file and use the URL's hash for
  location data.

  ```mdx
  Home page:  
  https://example.com/

  About page:  
  https://example.com/#/about
  ```

  Since the location is represented in the URL's hash, and the server only
  uses the location's path to map resources, all requests to the server
  would be routed to the `index.html` file.

- Configure the server to send the `index.html` file for all requests
- The alternative approach is to generate static HTML files for each page
  in the application. There are tools like static site generators that can
  assist you in doing so, examples would be NextJS.

## Serving SPA with a Dynamic Server

A dynamic server not only fulfills requests for static resources but also
extends the capabilities of a static server to employ server-side rendering
(generate HTML files at request time) and also respond to API calls. A
dynamic server can also respond with a common HTML file from the disk for
all other requests.

```js
// match static files requests
app.use('/static', express.static('public'))

// match API requests
app.use('/api', api_router)

// match everything else
app.use('*', function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile('/public/index.html')
})
```

## Recap

If you are using a static file host, you will either need to configure the
server to send the `index.html` file for all requests or generate an HTML
file for every possible route in your application at build time using tools
like NextJS.

Dynamic servers make serving single-page applications easy by using
catch-all routes to respond to requests for any location with `index.html`
while also handling static resources and API calls.
