[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a superset of markdown that allows you to use
JSX in your markdown files. You can import and embed components in your
content to add interactivity to your otherwise static markdown.

### Why Markdown?

Markdown often feels more natural to type, its brief syntax can enable you
to write content that is both readable and maintainable. Markdown typically
looks more like what's intended. So instead of the following HTML:

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>A blockquote with <em>some</em> emphasis.</p>
</blockquote>
```

you can write:

```markdown
> A blockquote with _some_ emphasis.
```

However, markdown is essentially static content, where MDX shines is in its
ability to let you use your React components directly in the markup.

### Under the Hood

Internally MDX uses remark and rehype.
[Remark](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/remark/) is a markdown
processor powered by plugins. Plugins allow you to transform the processed
markdown. [Rehype](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/rehype/) is an
HTML processor, also powered by plugins. Similar to remark, these plugins
let you compile and transform your content.

## Using MDX with Next.js

Generally speaking, there are two approaches to integrate MDX in your
NextJS project that mainly depends on your data source (where your content
is stored) and how you're planning to use components inside your MDX files.

For local files (stored in the local file system), you can use the
`@next/mdx` package from NextJS team. This allows you to create pages
directly with the `.mdx` extension inside your `pages/` folder.

For local and/or remote data (stored in a different repo, database or CMS),
one option is to use `next-mdx-remote` package (a third-party package) that
allows you to load MDX data inside `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`
in the same way you would normally load any other data in NextJS.

Let's look at implementing each package in more details.

## `@next/mdx`

As mentioned above, the `@next/mdx` package sources data from local files,
allowing you to create pages with a `.mdx` extension, directly in your
`/pages` directory.

The following steps are directly from
[NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx)

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
  npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

2. Configure NextJS to support top level `.mdx` pages:

```js showLineNumbers title="next.config.js"
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: []
  }
})

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']
})
```

3.  Create a new `.mdx` page in the `/pages` folder and that's it, you can
    start writing content and your pages will be served at the
    corresponding route.

### Using Components

Now that your NextJS app is configured to read MDX files you can add React
components inside your MDX pages.

```mdx {1,15} showLineNumbers
import { MyComponent } from '../components/...'

# My MDX page

This is an unordered list

- Item One
- Item Two
- Item Three

<section>And here is _markdown_ in **JSX**</section>

Checkout my React component

<MyComponent />
```

### JS Expressions

MDX supports JavaScript expressions inside curly braces, basically any JS
expression that evaluates to something that can be rendered:

```mdx
Here is a random number: { Math.random() }
```

### Import & Export

MDX also supports ESM import and export statements. Note how we imported an
external component while also defining a local one to use in our MDX page.

```mdx {2-4, 10} showLineNumbers
import { ExternalComponent } from './components/...'
export const LocalComponent = props => (
  <span style={{ color: 'red' }} {...props} />
)

<ExternalComponent />

# Here is the local component

<LocalComponent>Hello...</LocalComponent>.
```

You can also import data or export variables that can be used inside the
MDX file:

```mdx {2} showLineNumbers
import { Chart } from './chart.js'
import sales from './sales.js'
export const year = 2022

<Chart data={sales} label={year} />
```

### MDX Content

The main content of an MDX file is exported as a component , this means you
can use it inside other components as well as other MDX files. Take
`example.mdx` file:

```mdx showLineNumbers title="example.mdx"
export const Greet = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello {name}</h1>

<Greet name="Alice" />
```

You can now use the above MDX component in other files:

```mdx {1,5} showLineNumbers title="another.mdx"
import Example from './example.mdx'

# This is another mdx file

<Example />
```

Instead of importing or defining data within MDX, you can also pass data to
your MDX component via `props` and access them inside your MDX file.

```mdx showLineNumbers title="example.mdx"
# This is a markdown file expecting props

Hello {props.name.toUpperCase()}
```

It can be imported from another component and passed props like so:

```jsx {2,5} showLineNumbers title="home.jsx"
import Link from 'next/link'
import Example from './example.mdx'

const Home = () => {
  return <Example name="alice" />
}

export default Home
```

You can do a lot with MDX, as [Lee Rob](https://twitter.com/leeerob) put it
in this [blog post](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown)

> You can use the same component-based principles from React and apply them
> to authoring Markdown documents

For further readings, I recommend checking out the
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) docs.

### Layout

To add a layout to your MDX page, you can export a default function from
the page and wrap the MDX content with your layout component:

```jsx {5} showLineNumbers
import { Layout } from './components/...'

// MDX Content ... //

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
```

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is typically used to store meta data about a page. MDX does not
support frontmatter by default, however there are many solutions for adding
frontmatter support to MDX, such as
[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).

You can also use MDX's ESM `import/export` feature as an alternative to
frontmatter, you can export a meta object from within the `.mdx` file:

```mdx showLineNumbers
export const meta = {
  title: 'Article Title',
  excerpt: 'An article about such and such...',
  author: 'John Doe'
}

# {meta.title}
```

You might still prefer frontmatter though, as it can be extracted from the
file system before compiling your MDX file. For example:

```mdx showLineNumbers
---
title: Hello, there!
---

# Some title

some other content
```

Using gray-matter you can access the frontmatter:

```js {11} showLineNumbers
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

const root = path.join(process.cwd(), 'pages', 'blog')

export const getPostFrontmatter = slug => {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.mdx$/, '')
  const filePath = path.join(root, `${realSlug}.mdx`)
  const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8')
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContent)
  return data // this is the frontmatter
}
```

As mentioned earlier, MDX doesn't understand frontmatter by default, so we
need to tell it to ignore the frontmatter otherwise it'll show up in the
final output. We can do so by using a remark plugin,
[remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter). We
can add the plugin in our config file.

The only problem is that `remark-frontmatter` is ESM only package, which
means we can't use it in our current commonJS config file. Luckily, from
NextJS 12, ES modules are supported in the config file by renaming it to
`next.config.mjs`

```js {7} showLineNumbers title="next.config.mjs"
import nextMDX from '@next/mdx'
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter'

const withMDX = nextMDX({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter],
    rehypePlugins: []
  }
})

export default withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']
})
```

### Custom Components

So far we've seen how to use components in our MDX files by either
importing them or defining them locally. We can also pass components to our
MDX files using the `components` prop. It takes an object mapping component
names to the actual components.

```mdx showLineNumbers title="example.mdx"
# This is a markdown file

It is using a custom link component

<CustomLink href="/">Home</CustomLink>
```

The `CustomLink` component is not imported nor is it defined locally in
`example.mdx`; instead, it's passed to it using the `components` prop when
rendered in the Home page, like so:

```jsx {2,9} showLineNumbers title="home.jsx"
import Link from 'next/link'
import Example from './example.mdx'

const components = {
  CustomLink: props => <Link {...props} />
}

const Home = () => {
  return <Example components={components} />
}

export default Home
```

We can use this technique to add custom styles to any element, since
markdown is ultimately compiled to native HTML elements, we can create our
own custom components that map to regular HTML tags.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import Link from 'next/link'
import Image from 'next/image'
import Heading from './components/...'

const components = {
  h1: Heading.H1,
  h2: Heading.H2,
  a: props => <Link {...props} />,
  img: props => <Image alt={props.alt} layout="fill" {...props} />
  // ...
}
```

### MDX Provider

Passing components through props is fine but it can become cumbersome. To
solve this, we can use [@mdx-js/react](https://mdxjs.com/packages/react/)
which is a context provider that makes our custom components available to
all of our MDX files.

To set this up:

1. Install the `@mdx-js/react` package
2. Specify the `providerImportSource` in your config file:

```js {4} showLineNumbers title="next.config.mjs"
const withMDX = nextMDX({
  // ...
  options: {
    providerImportSource: '@mdx-js/react'
  }
})
```

3.  Use `MDXProvider` to wrap your highest level MDX component or the
    `_app.js` and pass a components object as a prop so all MDX pages can
    access your custom components.

```js {4,16-18} showLineNumbers
import Link from 'next/link'
import Image from 'next/image'
import Heading from './components/...'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'

const components = {
  h1: Heading.H1,
  h2: Heading.H2,
  a: props => <Link {...props} />,
  img: props => <Image alt={props.alt} layout="fill" {...props} />
  // ...
}

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MDXProvider components={components}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MDXProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

That's it for `@next/mdx`, you can get started with the
[with-mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx)
example template which uses this package to try out writing some MDX
content.

Now let's look at the `next-mdx-remote` package, how it's implemented and
how it differs from the first solution.

## `next-mdx-remote`

You can use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
to load MDX content through `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, the
same way you would load any other data.

```js showLineNumbers
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

import Test from '../components/test'

const components = { Test }

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = 'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />'
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }
}
```

This package exposes a function `serialize` which is intended to run server
side and a component, `<MDXRemote/>` for the client side.

`serialize` consumes a string of MDX and returns an object that should be
passed to `<MDXRemote/>` directly.

You can also optionally pass options:

```js
serialize(source, {
  scope: {},
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [],
    hastPlugins: [],
    compilers: [],
    filepath: '/some/file/path'
  },
  parseFrontmatter: false
})
```

- The `scope` object is used to pass props to the components used inside
  the MDX file. `scope` can also be passed to `<MDXRemote/>` component as a
  prop.
- `mdxOptions` are passed directly to the MDX compiler.
- `parseFrontmatter` indicates whether or not to parse the frontmatter from
  the mdx source.

`<MDXRemote/>` consumes the output of the `serialize` function as well as
optional components prop. Its result can be rendered directly in your
components.

```jsx
<MDXRemote
  compiledSource={string}
  components={object}
  scope={object}
  lazy={boolean}
/>
```

- `compiledSource` is exposed via the object returned from `serialize`.
- `components` takes a components object to be used inside your MDX file.
- `scope` exposed either through `serialize` function or directly passed to
  the `<MDXRemote/>` as a prop, is used to provide props to the components
  used inside the MDX file.
- `lazy` takes a boolean and will defer hydration of the content if set to
  `true` to improve initial load time by immediately serving static markup.

#### Caveats

When using `next-mdx-remote`, ESM `import` and `export` statements cannot
be used inside your MDX files. If you need to use components in your MDX
files, they should be provided as a prop to `<MDXRemote/>` or via context.

### MDX Provider

If you want to make components available to any `<MDXRemote/>` being
rendered in your application, you can use `<MDXProvider/>` from
`@mdx-js/react`. You can also replace HTML tags by custom components in the
same way.

## Summary

When using `next-mdx-remote` you are not limited to storing your MDX files
locally. Also you are not bound to the filesystem based routing where
moving MDX pages around will also change the page's route (URL).

While this gives you flexibility on where you store your MDX files, it is
not as powerful as `next/mdx` when it comes to MDX features such as using
ESM `import/export`, JS expressions, exporting and importing MDX content as
components etc.

If you have a lot of files that all import, define and use different
components, or if you want to use the same component-based principles from
React and apply them to your markdown, you may benefit from using
`next/mdx` as `next-mdx-remote` is limited in that area. On the other hand,
if you want the freedom to load your data from within `getStaticProps` or
`getServerSideProps`, regardless of the source, in the same way you would
load any other data in NextJS, `next-mdx-remote` would be a better fit.
