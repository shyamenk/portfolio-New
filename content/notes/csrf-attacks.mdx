Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), is when an attacker forges a request to
your server from their own site, hence then name cross-site.

## How does a CSRF attack happen?

Typically an attacker would trick a user to click on a link or image that
takes the user to their phishing site where they have embedded a visible or
often hidden HTML form that sends a request to your site:

```html title="attacker.com"
<form action="https://www.yoursite.com/user/profile" method="POST">
  <button type="submit">Click here to win a car!</button>
</form>
```

If the user is logged in on your site, when the attacker forges the
request, the browser will send the user's session cookies along with the
request to your server. Your server receives the cookies and verifies the
session, authenticates the user and authorizes the request not knowing it
was originated from the attacker's site.

## How to mitigate CSRF attacks?

### Only use JSON APIs

If you're only accepting JSON in your backend rather than URL-encoded form
data, you eliminate the risk of the above HTML form request forged against
your server.

This is because there is no way for a form to send JSON requests without
using JavaScript, and JavaScript is same-origin restricted, meaning that
the browser blocks requests that are not from the same origin. This stops a
malicious site from accessing another site's data.

### Disable CORS

Disable cross-origin requests to stop other site accessing your data. If
you want to allow CORS for whatever reason, you should limit it to safe
methods, such as `GET`, `HEAD`, or `OPTIONS`.

### `GET` should be safe

Make sure all your `GET` requests are actually safe.

An HTTP method is safe if it doesn't alter the state of the server. In
other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. Common
safe HTTP methods are `GET`, `HEAD`, or `OPTIONS`.

### Avoid using POST

If you're not implementing the first recommendation and you are accepting
URL-encoded form data in your backend, at least avoid using `POST`
requests. Since forms can only send `GET` and `POST` requests, using other
methods like `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` can limit the attacker with fewer
options to exploit your site.

This leads to the next suggestions of not using method-override in your
applications.

### Don't use method override

HTML Forms are limited to sending `GET` and `POST` requests, many
applications use `method-override` to be able to use `PUT`, `PATCH`, and
`DELETE` requests over a regular form. This is a serious vulnerability,
since not only you're accepting HTML form data but you're also allowing
other HTTP methods to be performed by the same form.

Don't use method-override in your application - use JavaScript to handle
form submission and send JSON requests and only accept JSON in your
backend, while disabling CORS.

### CSRF Tokens

The final solution is using CSRF tokens, and here is how they work:

- Server generates and sends a CSRF token to the client
- Client includes the token in subsequent requests to the server
- The server verifies the token and rejects the request if the token is
  missing or invalid

This way, an attacker needs to get a valid token to be able to forge a
request to your site. For this they would have to use JavaScript and if
your site does not support CORS, then there's no way for the attacker to
get a valid token, thus eliminating the threat. **Make sure CSRF tokens can
not be accessed via JavaScript, and don't expose `/csrf` route to grab
tokens!**

CSRF tokens should be generated on a per-request basis and different every
time. But how can the server verify the authenticity of these tokens if
they are different for every request?

This is where the salt comes along, the server would generate a random salt
(e.g. a random string) and hashes this random salt with a secret (only
known to the server) to generate a token.

The server then sends the salt and the generated token to the client, which
is then returned by the client to the server on subsequent requests. Once
received, the server will hash the salt with it's own secret and compares
the result with the token also sent by the client; It proceeds if they
match and rejects if they don't.

If you're using a database store for your sessions, the salt is typically
saved in the database. If you're using cookie sessions however, the salt
will be sent to the client and stored as a cookie; Therefore it's important
to **to use `httpOnly` cookies that are not accessible via client-side
JavaScript.** You can read about the
[csurf](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/csurf.html) middleware
in Express for more details.

## Conclusion

Change as many of your APIs to be JSON APIs, disable CORS where not needed
and use CSRF tokens as the last line of defense to be safe.
