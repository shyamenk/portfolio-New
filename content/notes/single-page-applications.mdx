A single page application (SPA) re-renders its content in response to
navigation actions such as clicking a link, without making a request to the
server and reloading the page.

## How Does It Work?

In order to understand how single-page applications work, we first need to
understand the default browser behavior and it's native APIs.

### How Do Browsers Handle Navigation?

When you click a link, the browser changes the URL and triggers a request
to the endpoint specified in the link's `href` attribute.

The browser then receives the response and creates the DOM, which is a
document representing the page content. Each browser tab maintains a
session history, which is an array of location entries, containing
information about the location such its URL, state and the associated
document.

As you're navigating through different pages, the browser is building up a
session history. Each navigation makes a request to the server and creates
a new entry.

That is how navigation is handled by the browser, but we need to prevent
this default behavior for a single-page application to avoid requests
hitting the server on every navigation action.

How do SPAs prevent this default behavior?

### Location's hash `#`

Early single-page applications relied on the fact that you can change the
URL's hash segment without triggering the browser to send a request to the
server.

```mdx
Home page:  
https://example.com/

About page:  
https://example.com/#/about
```

Now that we've prevented the browser from sending a request to the server
by changing the location's hash, we need to trigger a re-render and show
the correct content corresponding to the newly added hash (`#/about` in the
example).

For that, single-page applications generally rely on a router. Routers are
made up of routes, which describe the location they should match. These
locations can be static paths like `/about` or dynamic paths like
`/products/:id`.

After matching a route, the router will trigger a re-render of the
application to render the corresponding component, giving the user the
impression of navigating to a different page.

While this worked, having to handle our routes using a hash string wasn't
ideal, until the `History API` was developed to add first-class support for
single-page applications.

### History API

The history object provides access to the browser's session history. It
exposes useful methods and properties that let you navigate back and forth
through the user's history, and manipulate the contents of the history
stack.

#### Properties

- **length (read-only)**: returns an Integer representing the number of
  elements in the session history, including the currently loaded page.

- **scrollRestoration**: allows setting default scroll restoration behavior
  on history navigation. This property can be either `auto` or `manual`.

- **state (read-only)**: returns a value representing the state at the top
  of the history stack (the current entry). This is a way to look at the
  state without having to wait for a `popstate` event. The value is
  initially `null` until the `pushState` or `replaceState` methods are
  used.

#### Methods

- **back()**: this asynchronous method goes to the previous page in the
  session history, the same action as when the user clicks the browser's
  Back button. Equivalent to `history.go(-1)`

- **forward()**: this asynchronous method goes to the next page in the
  session history, the same action as when the user clicks the browser's
  Forward button; this is equivalent to `history.go(1)`

- **go()**: asynchronously loads a page from the session history,
  identified by its relative location to the current page, for example, -1
  for the previous page or 1 for the next page. Calling `go()` without
  parameters or a value of 0 reloads the current page.

- **pushState(state, title, url)**: creates a new entry in the history
  stack using the _current document_ together with the specified state,
  title and if provided, URL.

- **replaceState(state, title, url)**: updates the most recent entry on the
  history stack to have the specified state, title and if provided, URL.

##### Changing the State

`pushState` and `replaceState` methods have the same signature:

- **state**: the state object is a JavaScript object which is associated
  with the entry. If you do not want to pass any state, pass `null`.

- **title**: or recently named `unused` exists for historical reasons and
  most browsers ignore this parameter. Passing an empty string here should
  be safe against future changes to the method.

- **url [optional]**: the new entry's URL is given by this parameter.
  **_Note that the browser won't attempt to load this URL after a call to
  `pushState` or `replaceState`_**. The new URL does not need to be
  absolute and if it's relative, it's resolved relative to the current URL.
  The new URL must be of the same origin as the current URL or it will
  throw an exception. If this parameter isn't specified, it's set to the
  document's current URL.

**Navigating in SPAs using the History API**

As explained above, we can use `history.pushState` or
`history.replaceState` to change the URL without sending a request to the
server. All that's left now, is to prevent the default browser behavior
when a link is clicked, which can be accomplished by adding an event
listener and using `event.preventDefault`.

A simple implementation could look like this:

```jsx {5,6} showLineNumbers
const Link = ({ children, href }) => (
  <a
    href={href}
    onClick={event => {
      event.preventDefault()
      history.pushState(null, '', href)
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </a>
)
```

Now that we've changed the URL and prevented the browser from sending a
request, all we need to do is to trigger a re-render of our application and
show the relevant components matching the new URL. This is typically
handled by the router module.

Fortunately router modules like [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
merge all of these necessary steps and behaviors into custom components,
hooks and APIs that can be used to handle client-side routing, freeing us
from having to implement this from scratch.

## Recap

That's it folks, we covered what a single-page application is, how it
handles client-side routing and how it differs from traditional
applications.

Next would be to understand how to serve single-page applications that use
client-side routing. Things like static vs dynamic servers, static site
generators, server-side route configuration and more. You can check the
