# Setting Up SSH for GitHub on Linux

In the world of cybersecurity, safeguarding your access to online services
is paramount. Secure Shell (SSH) keys provide a robust and secure method
for authenticating yourself to various services, GitHub included. By
eliminating the need for constantly entering your username and password,
SSH keys offer both convenience and enhanced security. In this guide, we
will take you through the process of setting up SSH for your Linux machine
and GitHub account.

You'll learn how to generate a secure SSH key pair, add it to your system's
SSH agent, and associate it with your GitHub account. The use of SSH keys
not only simplifies the authentication process but also adds an additional
layer of protection to your GitHub interactions.

Let's dive into the steps and explore how to establish a secure and
efficient SSH connection between your Linux system and GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A GitHub account: You can sign up for one at
  [GitHub](https://github.com).
- A Linux machine: This guide is tailored for Linux users.

## Step 1: Generate an SSH Key Pair

1. Open a terminal on your Linux machine.

2. Use the following command to generate a new SSH key pair. You can
   specify an email address associated with your GitHub account.

   ```bash title="bash"
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```

Options:

- `-t ed25519`: Specifies the type of key to create (Ed25519 is recommended
  for modern systems).
- `-C "your.email@example.com"`: An optional comment to help identify the
  key.

3.  You'll be prompted to choose a location to save the SSH key pair. Press
    Enter to accept the default location (usually `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) or
    provide a different path.
4.  Set a passphrase for additional security. This passphrase will be
    required each time you use the key.

## Step 2: Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent

1.  Start the SSH agent in the background.

    ```bash title="bash"
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

2.  Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent. Replace
    `/path/to/your/private/key` with the actual path to your SSH private
    key file.

    ```bash title="bash"
    ssh-add /path/to/your/private/key
    ```

    You'll be prompted to enter the passphrase for the private key.

## Step 3: Add Your SSH Key to GitHub

1.  Copy your public SSH key to your clipboard using the following command.
    Replace the file path if you used a different location during key
    generation.

    ```bash title="bash"
    xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

    Note: If you don't have `xclip` installed, you can use
    `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and manually copy the key.

2.  Log in to your GitHub account.
3.  Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select
    "Settings."
4.  In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys."
5.  Click the "New SSH key" button.
6.  Give your SSH key a title, and then paste the key from your clipboard
    into the "Key" field.
7.  Click "Add SSH key" to save it.

## Step 4: Test Your SSH Connection

To ensure that your SSH key is properly set up for GitHub, you can run the
following command:

```bash title="bash"
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a response like "Hi your.username! You've successfully
authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access." This confirms
that your SSH key is working correctly.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up SSH for GitHub on your Linux
machine. This secure authentication method will allow you to access your
GitHub repositories without entering your username and password each time.

Remember to keep your SSH private key secure and never share it with
others. If you encounter any issues, consult GitHub's official
documentation on SSH key troubleshooting for further assistance.
