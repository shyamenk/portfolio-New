# Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying React application with nginx on Linux

Are you eager to deploy your very own React application on a Linux server?
Perhaps you're a developer looking to take your project to the next level.
In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through the steps to deploy a
React app on a Linux server using NGINX, and I'll even share my personal
journey into Linux and deployment. Let's get started.

## **Step 1** - Launch Your VPS Linux Server

Before embarking on this exciting journey, you'll need a Virtual Private
Server (VPS) running Linux. You have the flexibility to choose a provider
that best suits your needs, such as Linode, AWS, or Digital Ocean. After
successfully creating your server, make sure to jot down the IP address
provided by the cloud provider.

## **Step 2** - Securely Access Your Server

The initial step is to connect to your Linux server securely. You can use
SSH (Secure Shell) for this purpose. Here's how you can dive into the
terminal:

```bash title="bash"
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

Upon running this command, you may encounter the authenticity prompt:

```
The authenticity of host 'your_server_ip' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

Simply answer with "yes," and it will then ask for your server's password.
After providing the password, you'll be successfully logged into the Linux
system.

## **Step 3** - Secure Your Server

Before we proceed further, it's essential to ensure that your server is up
to date and secure. Execute the following commands:

```bash title="bash"
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

### `Set Your Timezone`

You'll want to set the correct timezone for your server:

```bash title="bash"
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

Follow the GUI prompts to select your desired timezone.

### `Create a Non-Root User with Sudo Permissions`

Operating as the root user can be risky. It's safer to create a non-root
user with sudo privileges. Here's how you can do it:

```bash title="bash"
adduser your_username
# You'll be prompted to set a password for the user.

# After user creation, grant them sudo privileges:
sudo usermod -aG sudo your_username
# Now, log out from the root session:

logout
```

Once you've logged out, you can log in again, but this time using the new
user:

```bash title="bash"
ssh your_username@your_server_ip
```

### **Generate an SSH Key Pair for Added Security**

To enhance security further, generate an SSH key pair. Run the following
command on your local machine:

```bash title="bash"
ssh-keygen
```

This command will generate a pair of keys, a private key, and a public key.
The private key should be kept secure on your local machine, while the
public key can be added to the server for secure access.

To add the public key to your server, use the following command:

```bash title="bash"
ssh-copy-id your_username@your_server_ip
```

You'll be prompted to enter your user's password on the server. After
adding the public key, you can log in without a password, which
significantly enhances security.

### `Lock Down Root User Access`

For added security, we can disable root user login:

```bash title="bash"
your_username@localhost sudo passwd -d root
your_username@localhost sudo passwd -l root
```

This detaches and locks root login, making it more secure.

### `Test User Access`

To verify the changes, try to SSH in as the root user:

```bash title="bash"
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

You should receive an "access denied" message, confirming that root login
is locked down.

## **Step 4** - Setting Up NGINX

Now, let's set up NGINX, a robust web server and reverse proxy. NGINX will
serve your React app to the world. Here are the steps:

```bash title="bash"
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

This command installs NGINX on your server. Next, create a directory to
host your React app:

```bash title="bash"
sudo mkdir /var/www/your_domain_or_ip
```

Set the necessary permissions:

```bash title="bash"
sudo chmod 755 -R /var/www/your_domain_or_ip
sudo chown -R your_username:www-data /var/www/your_domain_or_ip
```

With the permissions in place, it's time to configure NGINX for your React
app. Open the NGINX configuration file:

```bash title="bash"
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain_or_ip
```

Within the configuration file, add the following:

```nginx title="Nginx"
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name your_domain_or_ip;

    root /var/www/your_domain_or_ip;
    index index.html;
}
```

After adding the configuration, close the editor and test the NGINX
configuration:

```bash title="bash"
sudo nginx -t
```

If everything is configured correctly, you will receive a success message:

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is OK
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### **Unlink default config**

Before we proceed to the next step, let's unlink the default configuration:

```bash title="bash"
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

### **Link New Configuration**

Link the new configuration to enable it:

```bash title="bash"
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain_or_ip /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

## **Step 5** - Deploying Your React App

With NGINX in place, it's time to deploy your React app. You'll need a
`deploy.sh` script in your project's root directory:

```bash title="bash"
echo "Switching to branch master"
git checkout master

echo "Building app..."
npm run build

echo "Deploying files to server..."
scp -r build/* your_username@your_server_ip:/var/www/your_domain_or_ip/

echo "Done!"
```

> Don't forget to give the script executable permissions:

```bash title="bash"
cd your_project_folder
chmod u+x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

When you run the script, it will prompt you for the server password. Once
entered, it will transfer all the files to your server, and you'll see
"Done!".

Now, after logging out and back in, visiting `your_domain_or_ip` in your
web browser will display your React app.

Your React app is now live for the world to see. You've successfully
deployed a React app on a Linux server with NGINX. I hope this guide helps
you on your journey into Linux and deployment!
