Generally speaking when it comes to deploying your NextJS application to
production, you have two options:

- **Static HTML export**: not all NextJS features are supported.
- **Standard build API**: supports all NextJS features (requires a NodeJs
  server).

## Static HTML export

Allows you to export your NextJS app to static files (HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, etc.), and does not require a NodeJs server to run.

Static export would be a good fit, if you're only using NextJS as a static
site generator and you don't need any of the following features that
require a server:

- Image Optimization with the _default loader_
- Internationalized Routing
- API Routes
- Rewrites

### Supported Features

Static export still supports most of NextJS features required to build a
static site, including:

- Dynamic routes using `getStaticPaths`
- Prefetching with `next/link`
- Preloading JavaScript
- Dynamic Imports
- Any styling options (e.g. CSS Modules, styled-jsx)
- Client-side data fetching
- `getStaticProps`
- `getStaticPaths`
- Image Optimization using a custom loader

## Standard Build API

If you want to utilize all NextJS features and build a hybrid site where
some of the pages are pre-rendered to static HTML, while others are
rendered at request time or revalidated from time to time, you can use the
standard NextJS build API which requires a server, for this you can either
use:

- Managed server with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Self-hosted server

### Managed NextJS with Vercel

Vercel is the fastest way to deploy your NextJS application, and it
requires no configuration. When deployed to Vercel, the platform
automatically detects NextJS and runs `next build` to create an optimized
build output, including:

- Assets are served from a
  [Global Edge Network](https://vercel.com/features/infrastructure)
- API routes are optimized as
  [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/features/infrastructure)
- Middlewares are turned into
  [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions)

In addition, Vercel provides features like:

- Performance monitoring unit
  [NextJS Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics)
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Custom domains
- CI/CD (through GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Image optimization using `next/image`

### Self-Hosted

You can self-host NextJS using any hosting provider that supports
[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
containers.

#### NodeJs

NextJS can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports NodeJs.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

Run `next build` to build your application, and `next start` to start the
NodeJs server. This server supports all features of NextJS.

#### Docker

NextJS can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Docker
containers, orchestrated or running inside a single node. For more
information check out the
[with-docker](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker)
example repository.

#### Note on Image Optimization

If you are using `next/image`, consider adding `sharp` for more performant
Image optimization in your production environment by running
`npm install sharp` in your project directory. This is not necessary for
Vercel deployments, as `sharp` is installed automatically.

## Before Going to Production

Before deploying your NextJS application to production, there are some
[recommendations by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/going-to-production)
team to ensure the best user experience.
