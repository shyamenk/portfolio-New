# How to Set Up a Nextcloud Server on Ubuntu 22.04

It's time to install Nextcloud! Nextcloud is the best platform for building
your very own self-hosted collaboration platform, complete with features
such as online document editing, file synchronization, calendar, contacts,
and countless plugins. In this guide, you'll be walked through the entire
process, and by the end, you'll have your very own Nextcloud server that's
completely set up and ready for action.

### Initial Server Setup

After setting up Ubuntu Server, create a user for yourself if you don't
already have one:

```shell
adduser <username>
```

Adding the user to the sudo group:

```shell
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

After creating your user, be sure to log out from root and log in as that
user.

### Updating Packages

Before continuing, let's make sure all installed packages are up to date:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

Clean up orphan packages (if there are any):

```shell
sudo apt autoremove
```

### Updating the Hostname

Edit the following files, and be sure they include the proper hostname or
domain name for your server:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/hostname
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Reboot your server so that all the changes we've made so far will take
effect:

```shell
sudo reboot
```

While that's rebooting, update DNS for the domain name if you have one, so
that can replicate while we finish the other steps.

### Downloading Nextcloud

We'll need to grab the Nextcloud zip file, which contains the necessary
files we'll be needing.
[Click here](https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.zip) to
open the download page, then copy the URL for the zip file.

On the server, download the Nextcloud zip file using the URL that you
copied from the site:

```shell
wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.zip
```

Note: If that URL doesn't work (it can change at any time), grab the URL
from the Nextcloud site.

### MariaDB Setup

#### Setting up the Database Server

First, let's install the `mariadb-server` package:

```shell
sudo apt install mariadb-server
```

Check the status of the MariaDB service:

```shell
systemctl status mariadb
```

#### Running the Secure Installation Script

Although there are many tweaks and adjustments you can make to secure
MariaDB, running the following command and answering the prompts will give
us a decent starting point:

```shell
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the prompts to set up some very basic security defaults for the
database server.

#### Creating the Nextcloud Database

Next, we'll create the database we'll be using for Nextcloud. To do this,
we'll need to access the MariaDB console:

```shell
sudo mariadb
```

Then, we'll create the database and set up permissions with the following
commands:

```shell
CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
SHOW DATABASES;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextcloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
CTRL+D to exit
```

### Apache Webserver Setup

#### Installing the Required Packages to Support Apache:

```shell
sudo apt install php php-apcu php-bcmath php-cli php-common php-curl php-gd php-gmp php-imagick php-intl php-mbstring php-mysql php-zip php-xml
```

Check the status with of Apache:

```shell
systemctl status apache2
```

#### Enable the Recommended PHP Extensions:

```shell
sudo phpenmod bcmath gmp imagick intl
```

#### Install zip and unzip the Nextcloud zip file:

```shell
sudo apt install unzip
unzip latest.zip
```

Now that we've unzipped the files, let's move the files to where they'll be
served from and also set the permissions as well:

```shell
mv nextcloud nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud
sudo mv nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud /var/www
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
```

#### Creating a Host Configuration File for Nextcloud

Next, we'll set up a config file for Apache that tells it how to serve
Nextcloud:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud.conf
```

Add the following contents to the file (be sure to adjust the file names to
match yours):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud"
    ServerName nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud

    <Directory "/var/www/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud/">
        Options MultiViews FollowSymlinks
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
   </Directory>

   TransferLog /var/log/apache2/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud_access.log
   ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud_error.log

</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the site:

```shell
sudo a2ensite apache-config-file-name.conf
```

#### Configuring PHP

The next step will have us change some PHP options. First, edit the
following file:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini
```

Adjust the following parameters:

```shell
memory_limit = 512M
upload_max_filesize = 200M
max_execution_time = 360
post_max_size = 200M
date.timezone = America/Detroit
opcache.enable=1
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=8
opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
opcache.memory_consumption=128
opcache.save_comments=1
opcache.revalidate_freq=1
```

Enable the following PHP mods for Apache:

```shell
sudo a2enmod dir env headers mime rewrite ssl
```

Restart Apache to ensure the new PHP settings take effect:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

#### Acquiring a TLS Certificate

Let's set up Let's Encrypt and obtain a certificate for our Nextcloud
installation. The following steps will guide you through the process.

Note: Instructions are taken from
[this link](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=apache&os=ubuntufocal),
which you may want to visit in case the instructions change in the future.

Ensure snapd is installed:

```shell
sudo apt install snapd
```

Install the core snap:

```shell
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
```

Install Certbot:

```shell
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

Attempt to obtain a certificate (DNS must have already propagated):

```shell
sudo certbot --apache
```

Answer the prompts carefully, and as long as you didn't overlook
everything, you should have your very own TLS certificate!

### Misc. Tweaks and Adjustments

#### Correct the Permissions of the `config.php` File

We definitely wouldn't want the `config.php` file to fall into the wrong
hands, as it contains valuable setup information regarding our Nextcloud
setup. Let's adjust the permissions to better protect it:

```shell
sudo chmod 660 /var/www/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud/config/config.php
sudo chown root:www-data /var/www/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud/config/config.php
```

#### Enable Memory Caching

Edit the Nextcloud config file:

```shell
sudo vim /var/www/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud/config/config.php
```

Add the following line to the bottom:

```php
'memcache.local' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\APCu',
```

#### Resolving Warnings Pertaining to the Default Phone Region

Edit the Nextcloud config file:

```shell
sudo vim /var/www/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud/config/config.php
```

Add the following line to the bottom of the file:

```php
'default_phone_region' => 'US',
```

Note: Be sure to change "US" in the above example to your two-character
country code if yours is not US.

#### Get Rid of the Image Magick Error

Install the `libmagickcore-6.q16-6-extra` package:

```shell
sudo apt install libmagickcore-6.q16-6-extra
```

#### Enabling Strict Transport Security

Edit the SSL config file for our Nextcloud installation:

```shell
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.learnlinux.cloud-le-ssl.conf
```

Add the following line after the ServerName line:

```apache
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains"
</IfModule>
```
