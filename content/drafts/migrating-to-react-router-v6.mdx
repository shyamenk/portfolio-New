**Switch**

```jsx
<Switch /> component has changed to <Routes />

<Switch>
    <Route path='/welcome'>
        <Welcome />
    </Route>
</Switch>
```

**element prop**

Instead of passing a component as the child to `<Route>` component when the
path matches, you would pass an “element” prop and pass the desired
component there.

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/welcome" element={<Welcome />} />
</Routes>
```

**exact prop**

We also no longer need the “exact” prop to be passed for matching the exact
path. It is now the default behavior.

If you still want the previous behavior, you can add a `*` wildcard
character to the end of your path and still match all paths that begin with
the specified path.

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/products/*" element={<Products />} />
</Routes>
```

This way if you have not defined a more specific path for what comes after
“/products” the above route will be picked up, but if you have a more
specific path defined, react-router v6 would pick that.

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/products/*" element={<Products />} />
  <Route path="/products/:productId" element={<ProductDetail />} />
</Routes>
```

In the above example, even though we have included a wildcard character
after “/products”, v6 would still match the second route because it is a
more specifically defined route.

Also, unlike v5 the order in which you register the routes doesn't matter,
v6 would try to match the best possible route regardless of the order they
were registered.

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/products/edit" element={<Products />} />
  <Route path="/products/:productId" element={<ProductDetail />} />
</Routes>
```

In the above example we had to register the “/edit” path before the dynamic
“/:productId” path or the “/:productId” would have always won. But in v6
the order doesn't matter as the best match would win.

**NavLink**

the `activeClassName` prop is removed in v6, but instead, you can pass a
function to the `className` prop to find out if the current link is active.

```jsx
<NavLink to="/" className={link => (link.isActive ? 'active' : '')}>
  Home
</NavLink>
```

**Redirect**

The `<Redirect />` component has changed to `<Navigate />`

```jsx
<Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<Navigate to='/welcome' />} >
    <Route path='/welcome' element={<Welcome />} >
</Routes>
```

If you want to truly redirect by replacing the current location instead of
pushing a new location object into the stack you should add the “replace”
prop.

```jsx
<Route path='/' element={<Navigate replace to='/welcome' />} >
```

**Nested Routes**

It is now mandatory to wrap your `<Route>` components with a `<Routes>`
component in all nested routes even if there is only one route. This is
also true for your top-level routes. Where in v5 wrapping your routes with
a `<Switch />` component was optional, in v6 you should always wrap your
`<Route />` with a `<Routes />` component.

But that's not all, you also need to add the `*` wildcard character to the
top-level route to also match the nested routes.

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/users/*" element={<Users />} />
</Routes>
```

And finally, you have to change the nested routes “path” to be relative to
the path of the top-level route they are nested in. This wasn't the case in
v5.

Inside of the User component you should have

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/new" element={<RegisterForm />} />
</Routes>
```

Instead of:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/users/new" element={<RegisterForm />} />
</Routes>
```

So you don't need to repeat the full path in the nested routes. Also, we no
longer need the prefix “/” in the beginning, we can just add

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="new" element={<RegisterForm />} />
</Routes>
```

Links will also need to be relative to the parent route.

You can alternatively define nested routes in your top-level component.

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/users/*" element={<Users />}>
    <Route path="new" element={<RegisterForm />} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

This way, you would see all your routes and nested routes in one place,
instead of spreading them across multiple components as you had to do in
react-router v5.

However, now that our nested route is not defined inside of the User
component (parent component) we should tell react-router where exactly we
want to render the content of the nested route when it is matched. For
that, we need to use the new `<Outlet />` component from react-router as a
placeholder to tell the router where to render the components of the nested
route when they match.

**useNavigate()**

Instead of using the `useHistory()` hook to push or replace a new location
and programmatically navigate the user, we can use the `useNavigate()`
hook.

```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate()
navigate('/')
```

And if you want to redirect the user you can pass a second argument to the
`navigate()` function and set the “replace” property to true. Which will
replace the current location (URL) instead of adding a new location to the
stack.

```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate()
navigate('/', { replace: true })
```

Forward and backward navigation is also possible with this `navigate()`
function, you just need to pass a number to tell the navigate function how
many pages you want to go backward or forward.

```jsx
navigate(1) // to go forward
navigate(-1) // to go backward
navigate(-2) // to go 2 pages back
```

**Prompt**

The prompt component which was used to prevent accidentally leaving a page
with unsaved changes no longer exists in the v6 as of now.
