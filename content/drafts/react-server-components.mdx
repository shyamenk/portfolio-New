React recently introduced server components. Server components are
components that are only ever rendered on the server. This not only enables
you the fetch data on the server and render components before sending them
to the client, but it also doesn't include any dependencies you imported
inside of your server-components in the client bundle which reduces the
size of the code your users have to download in the browser before being
able to interact with your app. React Server Components are still in
research and development.
