**What is a router and why do we need one?**

In a traditional multi-page app with a server-side routing, we would
typically build different HTML pages and store them on the server or
dynamically generate those HTML pages upon request and send them back to
the client, which is then rendered by the browser.

This means that every time the URL changes, the browser sends a request to
the server to fetch the corresponding resource - an HTML file, and
re-renders the page. This also wipes out any internal state we managed on
the previous page, which defies the purpose of using a client-side library
like React which is built upon the idea of the state. In React, the UI is a
function of the state.

To prevent sending a request to the server whenever the URL changes, we
need to handle the routing on the client-side so we can preserve our
application state while also routing the client to the correct “page”
(content) on our site. And that's why you need a router for your React app,
to perform client-side routing.

Though, It is important to understand that client-side routing is happening
all in the browser, we still need the server to send the initial HTML and
Javascript files.

Therefore our server should be configured to just send the index.html file
and all the necessary assets (such as client-side JavaScript and CSS) for
_all_ requests. And once the React and react-router are loaded on the
client side react-router can look at the path and render the correct page
and components.

**React Router**

Manages the URL state, listens for changes to that state and renders
different components based on that state. It also prevents links to send a
request to the server for a new HTML file and instead changes the URL
without reloading the page with the use of the browser History API.

**React Router V5**

The first step is to wrap our App component with the BrowserRouter
component provided by React-Router allowing it to control the routing in
our app.

**<Route />**

To define routes we can use the `<Route />` component. This component
requires a “path” prop that determines what URL this route should match,
once matched it would render the component we pass to is as a child.

```jsx
<Route path="/">
  <Home />
</Route>
```

This matches any URL that starts with “/”, like “/about”, if we want to
only match the exact path “/”, we can pass the exact prop.

```jsx
<Route path="/" exact>
  <Home />
</Route>
```

**<Link />**

Instead of using regular anchor tags `<a>` for links, we should use the
Link component from react-router, which prevents the default browser
behavior to send a request when and anchor tag is clicked.

In the Link component instead of the “href” attribute, we can specify the
destination with the “to” prop.

```jsx
<Link to="/">Home</Link>
```

The Link component internally renders an anchor tag, so you can pass any
classes you want with the use of the “className” prop to style your links.

```jsx
<Link to="/" className="link">
  Home
</Link>

// this would result in => <a href=”/” class=”link”>Home</a>
```

**<NavLink />**

To highlight the active link in the navigation links which represent the
current page we are on, we can use the NavLink component. It works the same
as the `<Link />` component but in addition, it can set a CSS class on the
anchor tag. We just need to tell NavLink which class to add and we do this
by activeClassName prop.

```jsx
<NavLink to="/" activeClassName="active">
  Home
</NavLink>
```

**Dynamic Routes**

```jsx
<Route path="/users" exact>
    <UsersList />
</Route>
<Route path="/users/:userId">
    <UserDetail />
</Route>
```

We can access the userId with the use of `userParams()` hook inside of the
UserDetail component:

```jsx
const params = useParams()
// params will be an object => { userId: 'u123' }
```

**<Switch />**

By default, react-router will match all the routes that match therefore
rendering all corresponding components alongside each other, and sometimes
that is the desired outcome, but if we only want to match one route and
render one component we can use the Switch component which stops when the
first route is matched. To use Switch you just need to wrap your Route
components with a Switch component.

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route path="/users" exact>
    <UsersList />
  </Route>
  <Route path="/users/:userId">
    <UserDetail />
  </Route>
</Switch>
```

React-router will go through your routes from top to bottom in order, and
when it finds a match it renders the child component and stops there. That
is why it is important to pass the “exact” prop in the previous example,
otherwise, the “/users” path will always match and we will never reach the
“/users/:userId” path. Alternatively, we could have changed the order of
the routes for the “/users/:userId” to come before “/users”.

**Nested Routes**

You could also add nested Routes in the components renders from your
top-level route components. For example, in the UsersList component, we can
add a nested route:

```jsx
const UserDetail = () => {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>The User Detail Page</h1>. . .
      <Route path="/users/new">
        <NewUserForm />
      </Route>
    </section>
  )
}
```

**<Redirect />**

To redirect the user we can use the Redirect component, which redirects the
user to the specified path in the “path” prop:

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/">
    <Redirect to="/welcome" />
  </Route>
  <Route path="/welcome">
    <Welcome />
  </Route>
</Switch>
```

Again notice the “exact” prop to avoid matching literally all URLs since
they all begin with “/”.

**Catch-All Route**

We can have a catch-all page that returns a fallback page like a 404 page
if the user goes to a URL that does not exist in our routes. We do this by
adding a catch-all `*` route to the end of our routes.

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/">
    <Home />
  </Route>
  <Route path="/users">
    <UsersList />
  </Route>
  <Route path="*">
    <NotFoundPage />
  </Route>
</Switch>
```

**useHistory()**

Using this hook to programmatically navigate the user to a different page,
for example upon form submission, or to just update the URL by
adding/editing the query strings, which stays on the same page but
re-renders the component reflecting the new URL state.

```jsx
const history = useHistory()
history.push('/')
history.replace('/')
```

Or just change or add query strings:

```jsx
history.replace('/products?sort=asc')
```

`replace()` is like redirect, the user cannot go back to the previous page
because we replaced the location. where `push()` would add a new entry in
the history stack and the user can navigate back to the original page when
the location changes either by pushing or replacing the router matches the
path and renders the corresponding page and components even if we push the
current page, it will re-render the current page

**useLocation()**

Using this hook gives you a location object to read different parts of the
URL.

```jsx
const location = useLocation()
const query = new URLSearchParams(location.search)
// location object will look like this:
{
  hash: "",
  key: "bpetwt",
  pathname: "/quotes",
  search: "?sort=price",
  state: undefined
}
```

**useRouteMatch()**

Using this hook gives you an object that contains information about the
matched route, such as its path, URL and whether or not it was an exact
match.

```jsx
const match = useRouteMatch()
// match object will look like this:
{
  isExact: true
  params: {
    quoteId: 'q1'
  }
  path: '/quotes/:quoteId'
  url: '/quotes/q1'
}
```

**Note**

If you want to check if the current URL contains a specific path, you can
use the functionality already provided the react-router components like
`<Route>` to match your desired route and perform what you intended to.

React-router is managing a state for use, and that is the location (URL)
state, we can read it, update it and when so react-router will re-render
our components.

You can use nested routes to conditionally render different content based
on the URL, without having to manage any extra state. React-router is
already managing the URL or location state for you.

```jsx
const match = useRouteMatch()

{
  match.isExact && (
    <div className="centered">
      <Link to={`${match.url}/comments`} className="btn--flat">
        Show comments
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can even use the `<Route>` component to match that:

```jsx
<Route path={match.path} exact>
  <div className="centered">
    <Link to={`${match.url}/comments`} className="btn--flat">
      Show comments
    </Link>
  </div>
</Route>
```
