Real estate application that allows users to create accounts, search, like
and save listings, look up neighborhood stats and listing history including
sold data.

You can visit the live application on
[nest zoom realty's](https://www.nestzoom.com/) website.

## Tech stack

This is a fullstack JavaScript application that incorporates a
non-relational database. For safety reasons, we won't dive into the tech
stack. However, we'll describe some of the application features and
challenges along the way in more detail.

## Features

- Search autocomplete on address, neighborhood, city, postal code and MLS#
- Map search page for locating listings and neighborhoods more easily
- Map drawing tools to limit the search result to any desired area
- Ability to filter search results based on price, property type, location,
  number of beds/baths and more.
- Ability to save a search and get daily email updates
- Market stats page that aggregates common market indicators
- Neighborhood stats and listing history for each home
- Sold data and listing history going back two years

## Challenges

### RETS

The Real Estate Transaction Standard (RETS) is a technology used to
exchange standardized real estate data between clients and the Multiple
Listing Service (MLS).

This is an old standard and it's been entirely replaced in the US by API
based standards and protocols, but unfortunately still in use in major
cities in Canada.

Working with the RETS server from these MLS systems requires a RETS client
application to connect and fetch new listings and corresponding media,
however since this system is old and hardly used in bigger real estate
boards, the ecosystem of client libraries are limited and often very
outdated.

Fortunately we were able to fork an
[existing library](https://github.com/WinUP/rets-client) and twig it to fit
our target real estate board server configs.

### Micro services

We have implemented a dedicated server that connects to the real estate
board's server and pulls listing data on an hourly basis using the above
mentioned RETS client package.

### Asset management

We are using [Google cloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/) to store
media files (mainly listing photos) and
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) as our image optimization service to
serve optimized images on the fly based on the user's browsers.

### Maps and Geolocation

We are utilizing Google Maps API to geocode listings which enables map
search. We also had to integrate geo coordinates in our queries against the
database to accurately return results within the specified area.

The map search also features drawing tools. This will allow users to go
beyond defined neighborhood boundaries and limit their search result to any
desired area.

## In the pipeline

More features are in the coming for this app, some of which includes:

- Automated home valuation based on recent sales
- Adding sold data going back 15 years
- More search filters for more granular results
- Investment analysis metrics for each listing
- Ability to like listings and create favorite lists
- Live chat widget
- SEO optimization

We are currently rewriting the client side application in React to add a
more native app feel to the site. More specifically we'll be using NextJS
framework to serve static HTML when possible to improve user experience by
decreasing initial load times while also allowing search engines to
correctly index the page's content. NextJS also comes with built-in image
optimization that will hopefully replace the need for using a paid service
like Cloudinary.
