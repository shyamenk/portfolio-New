This is my own portfolio site built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and
deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It utilizes NextJS API routes
for the API layer, eliminating the need for an extra backend server to
serve the application in the first place and also to support things like
database connection.

## Tech stack

Selecting the tech stack when it comes to a personal portfolio site or
really any content oriented website, narrows down to either using a content
management system - short for CMS, or a custom solution that allows you to
create your content right inside of your project typically utilizing the
markdown language or the enhanced version of it which I'm using, MDX.

I'll probably have a future post at some point comparing different CMS
solutions and their pros and cons, but if you are a developer and already
familiar with markdown, you can read more on
[this post](/notes/using-mdx-with-nextjs) where I outline how to integrate
MDX into your NextJS application.

Here is the tech stack used in this project:

- NextJS
- MDX
- Tailwind
- MongoDB
- Vercel

## Features

Here are some of the features:

- NextJS API routes
- Dark theme support
- Newsletter subscription form
- Serving static pages for better user experience

## Challenges

Getting MDX set up properly was really the only challenge in terms of
deciding about the site architecture and where I wanted to source my
content, but other than that, working with NextJS was pretty straight
forward specially given that this project didn't have much complexity.

## In the pipeline

There isn't really much in the pipeline for now other than publishing more
content, but here are some ideas:

- Improving SEO
- Maybe a "Contact us" or "Hire me" page
- User authentication and payment options
