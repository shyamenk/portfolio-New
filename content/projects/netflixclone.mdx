The Netflix Clone is a web application that emulates the core functionality
of the popular video streaming platform Netflix. The app allows users to
browse and search for movies and TV shows, view detailed information about
them. The app is built using React, Firebase, and the MovieDB API, and
includes features such as user authentication, responsive design, and a
search bar that allows users to filter movies and TV shows based on various
criteria.

You can visit the live application on
[Netflix Clone](https://netflix-clone-d130f.web.app/) website.

## Tech stack

The following technologies were used to develop the Netflix Clone:

- [React js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - a JavaScript
  library for building user interfaces.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - A cloud-based platform for
  building web and mobile applications
- [Movie DB](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A RESTful API that provides
  access to a vast library of movies and TV shows Features

## Features

The following features were implemented in Netflix Clone:

- User authentication: Users can sign up for an account and log in to the
  app to access personalized recommendations and watch history.
- Movie and TV show listings: Users can browse and search for movies and TV
  shows.

## Challenges

While developing faced several challenges, including:

- Working with the MovieDB API: The API provides access to a vast amount of
  data, which can be overwhelming to work with.
- Ensuring responsiveness: Creating a responsive design that looks good on
  a variety of screen sizes and resolutions can be challenging.

## Next Steps

- Add support for multiple user profiles: Currently, the app only supports
  a single user profile. Adding support for multiple profiles would allow
  families or roommates to share an account and maintain their own
  watchlists and recommendations.
