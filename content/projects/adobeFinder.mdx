Adobe Finder is a web application that allows users to browse, add, edit
and search for properties that are available for rent or purchase.The app
includes features such as image uploads, dark mode functionality, and the
ability to filter search results based on various criteria. The app is
built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and MongoDB, with the ORM Prisma
used to interact with the database. Supabase is used for image uploads and
storage.

You can visit the live application on

## Tech stack

- [React js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - a JavaScript
  library for building user interfaces.
- [Next js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for the Web
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - statically typed superset
  of JavaScript
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A NoSQL database.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Rapidly build modern websites
  without ever leaving your HTML.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Next-generation ORM (Object-Relational
  Mapping) for TypeScript and Node.js
- [Supabse](https://supabase.com/) - A cloud-based database and
  backend-as-a-service (BaaS) provider.

## Features

The following features were implemented in Adobe Finder:

- Property listings: Users can browse and search for properties that are
  available for rent or purchase. Listings include property details,
  images, and contact information for the owner or agent.
- Image uploads: Users canupload images of their properties to the app
  using Supabase's image upload and storage functionality.
- Dark mode: Users can toggle between light and dark mode to suit their
  preferences.
- Filters: Users can filter search results based on various criteria, such
  as location, price, and property type.
- Authentication: Users can sign up for an account and log in to the app to
  save their favorite listings and receive updates on new properties that
  match their search criteria.

## Challenges

Developing Adobe Finder posed several challenges, including:

- Integrating multiple technologies: The app uses a variety of
  technologies, including Next.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Prisma, and
  Supabase. Integrating these technologies and ensuring they work together
  smoothly required careful planning and coordination.
- Implementing image uploads: Allowing users to upload images of their
  properties to the app required the use of a cloud-based storage solution,
  as well as careful consideration of security and performance
  implications.
- Ensuring scalability: As the app grows and more users begin using it,
  ensuring that it can scale to meet increased demand will be a critical
  consideration.

## Next Steps

- Implement additional filters: While the app currently supports filtering
  search results based on various criteria, there are additional filters
  that could be added to improve the user experience.
- Enhance performance: As the app grows and more users begin using it,
  optimizing performance will become increasingly important. This could
  involve implementing caching solutions, optimizing database queries, or
  making use of CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).
- Improve accessibility: Ensuring that the app is accessible to users with
  disabilities is an important consideration that should be addressed.
- Expand functionality: There are many additional features that could be
  added to Adobe Finder to improve its usefulness and appeal to users. For
  example, support for virtual property tours or video walkthroughs could
  be implemented, or social sharing functionality could be added to allow
  users to easily share listings with friends and family.
