This is a fullstack application, using [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
as the API layer, coupled with [EJS](https://ejs.co/) engine as a
templating engine and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database in the
backend, while utilizing vanilla JavaScript and
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) in the frontend.

You can visit the live application
[here](https://project-camp.herokuapp.com/) (you may have to wait for a
couple of seconds before the server becomes active).

## Features

This project was part of a web developer bootcamp I did when I was learning
to code. Essentially showcasing a fullstack JavaScript application with
session-based user authentication. It implements best practices of CRUD
operations in creating, reading, updating and deleting hypothetical
campsites around US. It allows users to add photos (hosted on
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)) to their camps while also reviewing
and rating other camps.

## In the pipeline

I'm not planning to add much to this project, as it is just showcasing
something I've built in the past. If you have any questions or want me to
build something similar for you shoot me a message.
