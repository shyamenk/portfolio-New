[Sweeter](https://sweeter-zeta.vercel.app/) is a Twitter clone built with
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/),
deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It utilizes NextJS API routes
for the API layer deployed as serverless functions.

Check it out [here](https://sweeter-zeta.vercel.app/)

## Tech stack

Here is the tech stack used in this project:

- NextJS
- NextAuth
- TailwindCSS
- MongoDB
- Vercel

## Features

Here are some of the features:

- NextJS API routes
- Client Side Rendering (CSR) using SWR library
- Authentication flows include passwordless login, Google and LinkedIn
  OAuth
- TailwindCSS and Headless UI for design and accessibility

You can create a user account, post new Sweets, follow and unfollow other
users and see their activities in your news feed.

## In the pipeline

Here are some of the missing features I'm currently working on:

- Ability to like, comment and resweet a sweet :)
- News feed infinite scroll pagination
- Adding DM functionality where you can send a private message using
  [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
